# weather-API

Hi everyone,

this is a learning project, weather checker built using openweathermap.org API. Based on a input of a city by user, basic weather info in JSON format is fetched from openweathermap API, decoded and displayed to user.

It was built with HTML, PHP and styled with Bootstrap.

Thank you for checking it! :)
