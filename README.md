# weather-API

Hi everyone,

this is a learning project, weather checker built using openweathermap.org API. Based on users input of city, basic weather info in jSON format from openweathermap API is fetched, decoded and displayed to user.

It was built with HTML, PHP and styled with Bootstrap.

Thank you for checking it! :)
